Tired, trudging through the deep snow, you wipe sleet from your face 
using a gloved hand. Face all but numb, you barely feel the encrusted 
ice on your glove rake across your cheek. The hand inside the glove lost
all feeling a while ago. What started out as a hiking trip in the foothills 
of the Andes mountains has turned into a full-blown survival nightmare in no 
time at all.

The trail map Ray had Googled up and printed on a sheet of paper has turned to 
mush in the rain. Rain turned to snow, falling thickly even now, and in the white 
world that surrounds you now a map would be of little use anyway. 

A whining baby, he called you when you suggested turning back when it 
started to rain. Ray just had to get to this viewpoint just over the hill. 
(_Suck it up, man! Grow a pair!_) There'd even been a sign stating in Spanish, 
English and German,

__IN CASE OF BAD WEATHER, DO NOT ATTEMPT THE TRAIL BEYOND THIS POINT.__

To Ray, that had been like a red cloth to a bull. Nothing bad could possibly
happen to _that_ guy.

"Ray! Wait up!" He doesn't hear you. The snow swallows up all sounds.
He's disappeared beyond a group of snow-covered boulders up ahead, leaving you
no choice but to hustle and catch up.
